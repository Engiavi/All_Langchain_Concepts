Beneath the sun on a field so wide,
Where dreams and leather-balls collide,
Eleven hearts take up the chase,
In white-clad grace, they find their pace.

The bowler runs with fire and flair,
Wind in hair, with a steely stare,
He bends his back, the seam he shows—
A thunderbolt the batsman knows.

The willow speaks, a cover drive,
The crowd erupts, the game’s alive!
A flick, a pull, a lofty sweep,
The scoreboard climbs, no time for sleep.

The keeper crouched like silent prey,
The slips await their golden day,
A nick, a gasp, the edge so fine—
Caught! The fielders cross the line.

Spin weaves webs in twilight's hue,
Each ball a question, sly and true.
The batter dances down the track—
Too late! The stumps are lying back.

A captain’s plan, a fielder’s dive,
A no-look throw to keep hopes alive.
Nerve and grit in every frame,
This isn’t sport—it’s war and flame.

From gullies low to skies above,
Cricket's more than sport—it’s love.
It teaches loss, it teaches pride,
It’s where the soul and skill collide.
